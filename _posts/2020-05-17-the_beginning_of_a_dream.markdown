It has been a long journey just to get to the starting line of this new career venture of Coding for me. Getting into software development has been an avenue  I desired taking for a couple of years now. I have been working in the world of finance for over three years now, but I have always desire something that was more challenging and held a bigger impact. 

I was introduced to software development by a friend that is in the industry and all he does is talk about the amazing things that he does day to day on the job. It all sounded like something that I found a strong intrest in. Finding the right Coding Academy and the time to actually be in school was the biggest battle. I have been challeneged with **Flatiron** since the day I begun and I would not have it any other way. I love the challenge and I can't wait to see what the future holds for me in the world of coding!
