I had legit no clue if I was going to be able to make it through this first project. I have never been so challenged in my life. I never believed the most challenging situation would be presented to me through a computer screen. It is a completely different ball game when you do not have the Learn tips in handy in order to handle an assignment. Here i am though, I made it. Well I still have to pass the review, but I'm thankful I've made it thus far. 

This assignment truly helped me understand why Coders already in the industry tell you to make Google your best friend. The search engine had to become my best friend for me to make it through. Figuring out my CLI and API file was very challenging, but now I hunger to keep practicing and mastering the craft! It is a relief to be completely done and have my program operating correctly. I am excited to see how far I actually take my Software Engineer journey!
